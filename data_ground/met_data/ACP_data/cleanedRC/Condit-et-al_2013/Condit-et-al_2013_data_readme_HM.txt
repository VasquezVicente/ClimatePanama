NOTE from Helene Muller-Landau:  TreeCommunitDrySeasonStationSite.txt only includes site name, elevation and location (not years of data and calculated dry season moisture deficit), contrary to what is stated in the metadata.

Abstract:
Woody plant species with free-standing stems >=1 cm diameter were surveyed at 72 locations near the Panama Canal, spanning geological formations and a rainfall gradient. Patterns of tree species distribution relating to soil and rainfall variation are presented in the publication cited below. Full data tables on which the results were based are provided here in five different files, including the occurrence of 550 tree species, soil chemistry, and dry season intensity at all the sites, along with descriptions of the data.

CITATION TO DATA: Condit, R.; Engelbrecht, B.; Pino, D.; Turner, B.; Pérez, R. 2013. Panama Tree Distribution Database. DOI http://dx.doi.org/10.5479/data.bci.20130204.
 
CITATION TO PUBLICATION: Condit R, Engelbrecht BMJ, Pino D, Pérez R, Turner BL (2013) Species distributions in response to individual soil nutrients and seasonal drought across a community of tropical trees. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 10.1073/pnas.1218042110.
 
File 1. TreeCommunityDrySeasonDailyRain.txt: Daily rainfall over 3-47 years at 47 rainfall stations: date, rainfall in millimeters, site name; the file includes a full year of records for all site-year combinations, with 0 meaning no rainfall. Note, however, that there are cases, especially weekends, where Saturday and Sunday have 0, then Monday's record has the entire weekend's rain. Rainfall totals are thus complete, but estimating the number of days with rain would require care.
 
File 2. TreeCommunityDrySeasonStationSite.txt: Calculated mean extreme dry season moisture deficit at the 47 rainfall stations, with site name, years of data, UTM northing (zone 10), UTM easting (zone 10), and elevation (meters). The extreme moisture deficit of any one dry season is defined as millimeters of cumulative precipitation minus evapotranspiration at its most negative over any period of days spanning the dry season. The table includes a single average at each site, the average of all years for which data were available at the site.
 
File 3. TreeCommunityDrySeasonSurveySite.txt: Interpolated mean extreme dry season duration at 72 forested sites where tree species were surveyed, with site name, UTM northing (zone 10), UTM easting (zone 10), and elevation (meters).
 
File 4. TreeCommunityDrySeasonSpeciesOccurrence.txt: Occurrences of 550 tree species at the same 72 sites, with taxonomic name (genus, species, family), site name, and occurrence (=1 if species was observed, =0 if not observed)
 
File 5. TreeCommunityDrySeasonSpeciesResponse.txt: Response parameters for 550 species occurrences from model using eight climatic and soil predictors in an hierarchical Gaussian logistic regression: Latin (Family), number of occurrences at 72 sites, then the model's 17 parameters per species, which are one intercept plus first and second order responses (the second order parameter is labelled ^2; 'Moist' means dry season moisture deficit; other parameters labelled with soil element).
