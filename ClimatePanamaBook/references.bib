We apply the method to the {ERA}5 precipitation archive and {MODIS} monthly cloud cover frequency to develop a daily gridded precipitation time series in 1 km resolution for the years 2003 onward. Comparison of the predictions with existing gridded products and station data from the Global Historical Climate Network indicates an improvement in the spatio-temporal performance of the downscaled data in predicting precipitation. Regional scrutiny of the cloud cover correction from the continental United States further indicates that {CHELSA}-{EarthEnv} performs well in comparison to other precipitation products. The {CHELSA}-{EarthEnv} daily precipitation product improves the temporal accuracy compared with a large improvement in the spatial accuracy especially in complex terrain.},

These data provide important inputs for ecological and hydrological studies at global scales that require high spatial resolution and time varying climate and climatic water balance data. We validated spatiotemporal aspects of {TerraClimate} using annual temperature, precipitation, and calculated reference evapotranspiration from station data, as well as annual runoff from streamflow gauges. {TerraClimate} datasets showed noted improvement in overall mean absolute error and increased spatial realism relative to coarser resolution gridded datasets.},

              We introduce a set of global high-resolution (0.05°) precipitation (

              ) climatologies corrected for bias using streamflow ( 
              Q 
              ) observations from 9372 stations worldwide. For each station, we inferred the “true” long-term 
              P 
              using a Budyko curve, which is an empirical equation relating long-term 
              P 
              , 
              Q 
              , and potential evaporation. We subsequently calculated long-term bias correction factors for three state-of-the-art 
              P 
              climatologies [the “{WorldClim} version 2” database ({WorldClim} V2); Climatologies at High Resolution for the Earth’s Land Surface Areas, version 1.2 ({CHELSA} V1.2 ); and Climate Hazards Group Precipitation Climatology, version 1 ({CHPclim} V1)], after which we used random-forest regression to produce global gap-free bias correction maps for the 
              P 
              climatologies. Monthly climatological bias correction factors were calculated by disaggregating the long-term bias correction factors on the basis of gauge catch efficiencies. We found that all three climatologies systematically underestimate 
              P 
              over parts of all major mountain ranges globally, despite the explicit consideration of orography in the production of each climatology. In addition, all climatologies underestimate 
              P 
              at latitudes {\textgreater}60°N, likely because of gauge undercatch. Exceptionally high long-term correction factors ({\textgreater}1.5) were obtained for all three 
              P 
              climatologies in Alaska, High Mountain Asia, and Chile—regions characterized by marked elevation gradients, sparse gauge networks, and significant snowfall. Using the bias-corrected {WorldClim} V2, we demonstrated that other widely used 
              P 
              datasets ({GPCC} V2015, {GPCP} V2.3, and {MERRA}-2) severely underestimate 
              P 
              over Chile, the Himalayas, and along the Pacific coast of North America. Mean 
              P 
              for the global land surface based on the bias-corrected {WorldClim} V2 is 862 mm yr 
              −1

	abstract = {Abstract. Accurate representations of mean climate conditions, especially in areas of complex terrain, are an important part of environmental monitoring systems. As high-resolution satellite monitoring information accumulates with the passage of time, it can be increasingly useful in efforts to better characterize the earth's mean climatology. Current state-of-the-science products rely on complex and sometimes unreliable relationships between elevation and station-based precipitation records, which can result in poor performance in food and water insecure regions with sparse observation networks. These vulnerable areas (like Ethiopia, Afghanistan, or Haiti) are often the critical regions for humanitarian drought monitoring. Here, we show that long period of record geo-synchronous and polar-orbiting satellite observations provide a unique new resource for producing high resolution (0.05°) global precipitation climatologies that perform reasonably well in data sparse regions.  Traditionally, global climatologies have been produced by combining station observations and physiographic predictors like latitude, longitude, elevation, and slope. While such approaches can work well, especially in areas with reasonably dense observation networks, the fundamental relationship between physiographic variables and the target climate variables can often be indirect and spatially complex. Infrared and microwave satellite observations, on the other hand, directly monitor the earth's energy emissions. These emissions often correspond physically with the location and intensity of precipitation. We show that these relationships provide a good basis for building global climatologies. We also introduce a new geospatial modeling approach based on moving window regressions and inverse distance weighting interpolation. This approach combines satellite fields, gridded physiographic indicators, and in situ climate normals. The resulting global 0.05° monthly precipitation climatology, the Climate Hazards Group's Precipitation Climatology version 1 ({CHPclim} v.1.0, http://dx.doi.org/10.15780/G2159X), is shown to compare favorably with similar global climatology products, especially in areas with complex terrain and low station densities.},

            The Climate Hazards group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) dataset builds on previous approaches to ‘smart’ interpolation techniques and high resolution, long period of record precipitation estimates based on infrared Cold Cloud Duration (CCD) observations. The algorithm i) is built around a 0.05° climatology that incorporates satellite information to represent sparsely gauged locations, ii) incorporates daily, pentadal, and monthly 1981-present 0.05° CCD-based precipitation estimates, iii) blends station data to produce a preliminary information product with a latency of about 2 days and a final product with an average latency of about 3 weeks, and iv) uses a novel blending procedure incorporating the spatial correlation structure of CCD-estimates to assign interpolation weights. We present the CHIRPS algorithm, global and regional validation results, and show how CHIRPS can be used to quantify the hydrologic impacts of decreasing precipitation and rising air temperatures in the Greater Horn of Africa. Using the Variable Infiltration Capacity model, we show that CHIRPS can support effective hydrologic forecasts and trend analyses in southeastern Ethiopia.},
